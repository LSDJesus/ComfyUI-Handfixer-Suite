## Basic Usage

### Basic Node

1. Add the "JoyCaption" node from the `üß™AILab/üìùJoyCaption` category
2. Connect an image source to the node
3. Select the model file (defaults to `llama-joycaption-beta-one-hf-llava`)
4. Adjust the parameters as needed
5. Run the workflow

### Advanced Node

1. Add the "JoyCaption (Advanced)" node from the `üß™AILab/üìùJoyCaption` category
2. Connect an image source to the node
3. Select the caption type
4. Adjust the parameters as needed
5. Run the workflow

### Parameters

#### Basic Node

| Parameter | Description | Default | Range |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- | ----- |
| **Model** | The JoyCaption model to use | `llama-joycaption-beta-one-hf-llava` | - |
| **Memory Control** | Memory optimization settings | Default | Default (fp32), Balanced (8-bit), Maximum Savings (4-bit) |
| **Caption Type** | Caption style selection | Descriptive | Descriptive, Descriptive (Casual), Straightforward, Tags, Technical, Artistic |
| **Caption Length** | Output length control | medium | any, very short, short, medium, long, very long |


### Quantization Options

| Mode | Precision | Memory Usage | Speed | Quality | Recommended GPU |
|------|-----------|--------------|-------|---------|----------------|
| Default | fp32 | ~16GB | 1x | Best | 24GB+ |
| Default | bf16 | ~8GB | 1.5x | Excellent | 16GB+ |
| Default | fp16 | ~8GB | 2x | Very Good | 16GB+ |
| Balanced | 8-bit | ~4GB | 2.5x | Good | 12GB+ |
| Maximum Savings | 4-bit | ~2GB | 3x | Acceptable | 8GB+ |

#### Advanced Node

| Parameter | Description | Default | Range |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- | ----- |
| **Extra Options** | Additional feature options | [] | Multiple options |
| **Person Name** | Name for person descriptions | "" | Any text |
| **Max New Tokens** | Maximum tokens to generate | 512 | 1-2048 |
| **Temperature** | Generation temperature | 0.6 | 0.0-2.0 |
| **Top-p** | Sampling parameter | 0.9 | 0.0-1.0 |
| **Top-k** | Top-k sampling | 0 | 0-100 |
| **Precision** | Use fp32 for best quality, bf16 for balanced performance, fp16 for maximum speed. 8-bit and 4-bit quantization provide significant memory savings with minimal quality impact |

## Setting Tips

| Setting | Recommendation |
| ------- | -------------- |
| **Memory Mode** | Based on GPU VRAM: 24GB+ use Default, 12GB+ use Balanced, 8GB+ use Maximum Savings |
| **Input Resolution** | The model works best with images of 512x512 or higher resolution |
| **Memory Usage** | If you encounter memory issues, try using 4-bit mode or processing images at a lower resolution |
| **Performance** | For batch processing, consider reducing max_new_tokens for faster throughput |
| **Temperature** | Lower values (0.6-0.7) for more stable results, higher values (0.8-1.0) for more diverse results |
